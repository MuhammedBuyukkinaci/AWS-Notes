# AWS-Notes

This is listing my learning from [Cloud Computing Basics and Introduction to AWS Solution Architect](https://www.udemy.com/course/bulut-bilisim-temelleri-ve-aws-cozum-mimarligina-giris/).

## Introduction & Cloud History

1) The reason why Cloud Computing became popular is that Network capabilities have developed a lot.

2) 93% of companies use cloud computing in any way.

3) AWS is bigger than the collection of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba cloud, IBM cloud and oracle cloud.

4) AWS Certificates:

5) In order to install AWS CLI, activate a Python environment and install the following

```run.sh
pip install awscli
```

6) Virtualization software is installed on top of physical machine.

7) How to build a data center

    - Security, not allowinh everyone to enter
    - Keeping the temperature cold
    - UPS devices against short electricity cuts and generators against long electricity cuts.
    - Buy rack cabinets to place servers(physical machines)
    - Providing networking via ethernet cables.
    - Security cameras to secure data center

8) Some companies decided to have a single data center rogether rather than multiple data centers. This concept is called as **colocation**. In this concepts, each company has different rack cabinets. This approach reduced the cost of air-conditioning&security dramatically but not didn't solve the capacity problem.

9) IaaS solved the problem of insfrasracture, capacity and data centers by intorucing selling Vm's for customer directly. The IaaS provider is responsible for all physical infrastructure. The renters are responsiblge for their VM's.

10) Cloud computing is not a product, it is a service.

11) On premises, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

12) AWS EC2 is an example of IaaS.

13) PaaS is a further step to IaaS. In PaaS, we are just managing data and application and other layers are managed by our providers. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an example of PaaS. Heroku is an example of PaaS too.

14) In SaaS, everything is under the responsibility of our provider. We are just using it by paying. Gmail is an example of SaaS.

16) Beta Release is carried out with customer. Beta version is launched and sent to customer first, then feedbacks are taken into consideration.

17) SaaS is predominant now in industry. SaaS is like renting a car rather than purchasing a car.

18) DevOps is a philasophy, not a method.

19) Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Chef and Github actions are some softwares that are used in CI/DC processes.

20) Monolith applications are

    - hard to sustain
    - not flexible
    - hard to fix
    - having only one codebase
    - bulky

21) API is an explicitly defined communication management approach among different applications.

22) API Gateway is illustrated below. Common missions of API Gateway is direction, merging and protocol translation. Also, they are responsible for authentication, load balancing, monitoring. "One Api to rule them all".
